   [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

## Step 2: Create a New MetaMask Wallet

1. **Click on the MetaMask icon** in your browser toolbar to open MetaMask.

2. You will be greeted with a welcome screen. Click on **"Get Started"**.

3. Select **"Create a Wallet"** option.

   - Make sure to use a unique and secure password.

5. **Save your Recovery Seed Phrase**:  
   - MetaMask will provide you with a 12-word **recovery seed phrase**. This is crucial for recovering your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your wallet.

6. After you have saved the seed phrase, click **"Next"**.

9. **You have successfully created your wallet!**

## Step 3: Add Ether or Tokens to Your Wallet

### Option 1: Get Ether from a Faucet (Test Networks)
If you want to experiment without spending real Ether, you can use a test network (such as **Rinkeby** or **Ropsten**) to get free Ether.

1. **Switch to a Test Network**:  
   In MetaMask, click on the **network dropdown** at the top and select **Rinkeby Test Network** or **Ropsten Test Network**.

2. **Use a Faucet to Get Test Ether**:  
   - Search for **Rinkeby faucet** or **Ropsten faucet** on the web and follow the steps to get free Ether sent to your wallet.  
   - You may need to provide your wallet address to receive test ETH.

### Option 2: Transfer Ether from Another Wallet (Mainnet)

1. If you are transferring real Ether from another wallet (e.g., Coinbase, Binance, or another MetaMask wallet), open your **MetaMask wallet** and:
   - Click **"Deposit"** in the wallet interface.
   - Select the **"Ethereum"** network.
   - Copy your **Ethereum address** (this address starts with **0x**).
   - Go to the other wallet or exchange and **send** Ether to the address you just copied.

## Step 4: Send Ether from Your Wallet (Make a Transaction)

1. To **send Ether**, click on the **"Send"** button in your MetaMask wallet.

2. **Enter the recipient's address**:  
   - This is the address of the wallet or exchange to which you want to send Ether.
   - Make sure the address is correct to avoid sending Ether to the wrong destination.

3. **Enter the amount** of Ether you wish to send.

4. **Adjust Gas Fee**:  
   - MetaMask will show you the **gas fee** required for the transaction. You can adjust the gas fee to prioritize faster transaction processing.
   - If you're unsure, it's usually fine to use the **default gas fee**.

5. **Review the transaction details**:  
   - Check the **amount**, **recipient address**, and **gas fees**.

6. **Click “Next”** to proceed with the transaction.

7. **Confirm the transaction** by clicking **"Confirm"**.

8. The transaction will be broadcast to the Ethereum network, and you'll be able to track it on a blockchain explorer like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

---

## Step 5: Track Your Transaction

1. After sending your transaction, you will get a **Transaction ID (TXID)** from MetaMask.

2. Go to **[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)** and paste the **TXID** in the search bar to track the transaction.

3. You can check the **status**, **gas fees**, and other details of the transaction on the blockchain explorer.

---

## Step 6: Receive Ether in Your Wallet

1. To **receive Ether**, click on the **"Deposit"** button in MetaMask.

2. **Copy your wallet address** and share it with the person or platform that is sending you Ether.

3. Once the transaction is confirmed, the received Ether will appear in your MetaMask wallet.

## Conclusion:
By following these steps, you have successfully created a MetaMask wallet, added Ether to your wallet, made a transaction, and learned how to track your transactions. You now have a basic understanding of how to interact with the Ethereum network using MetaMask.
