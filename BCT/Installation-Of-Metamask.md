# Practical Task: Installation of MetaMask and Study Ether Spending per Transaction

## Objective:

- Install MetaMask and set up a wallet.
- Study how Ether is spent per transaction by performing simple transactions and observing gas fees.

## Step 1: Install MetaMask Extension in Browser

1. **Open your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Brave)** and go to the official MetaMask website:  
   [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).
2. **Click on “Download”** and choose the extension suitable for your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Brave).

3. **Add MetaMask extension** to your browser. A MetaMask icon will appear in the upper-right corner.

## Step 2: Set Up MetaMask Wallet

1. **Click on the MetaMask icon** in the toolbar.
2. Select **"Get Started"** on the welcome screen.

3. Choose **"Create a Wallet"** if you're creating a new wallet or **"Import Wallet"** if you have an existing one.

4. **Set a strong password** for your wallet.

5. **Save your seed phrase** securely. This phrase is essential for recovering your wallet in case of issues.

6. Click on **"All Done"** once your wallet is set up.

## Step 3: Add Ether to Your Wallet (for Testing)

1. If you want to test on the **Ethereum mainnet**, make sure to purchase or transfer some Ether (ETH) to your MetaMask wallet.
2. If you're testing on a **test network** like **Rinkeby** or **Ropsten**, you can use a faucet to get free test Ether. Follow these steps:
   - Search for **"Rinkeby faucet"** or **"Ropsten faucet"** online.
   - Follow the instructions to get free test ETH sent to your wallet address.

## Step 4: Send Ether to Study Gas Fees

1. **Open MetaMask** and click on the **"Send"** button.

2. **Enter a recipient address** (for testing purposes, you can send it to another wallet or use a dummy address).

3. **Enter the amount of Ether** you want to send (e.g., 0.1 ETH for testing).

4. **Observe the Gas Fee:**
   - MetaMask will show you the **gas fee** estimate before confirming the transaction.
   - This gas fee is required to process the transaction on the Ethereum network.
5. You will see options for **gas price** (in Gwei) and **gas limit** (maximum amount of gas units).

   - The **gas price** is the fee per unit of gas (measured in Gwei).
   - The **gas limit** is the maximum amount of gas you’re willing to spend for this transaction.

6. **Click on "Next"** after reviewing the details.

7. **Confirm the Transaction**:
   - After confirming the transaction, MetaMask will show the total gas fee (which will be added to the amount of Ether you're sending).
   - Once the transaction is confirmed, it will be sent to the Ethereum network.

---

## Step 5: Track Gas Fees on an Ethereum Block Explorer

1. **After Transaction Confirmation**:
   - Copy the **transaction hash (TXID)** that MetaMask provides.
2. **Go to a Block Explorer** like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).
3. **Paste the TXID** in the search bar to track your transaction.
   - Here you can see detailed information about the transaction, including the **actual gas spent**.

---

## Step 6: Study Gas Prices and Gas Usage

1. **Check Gas Prices**:

   - Websites like [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/) or [Etherscan Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) provide current gas prices.
   - You can study how gas prices fluctuate with network congestion.

2. **Analyze Transaction Cost**:
   - Gas fees depend on **network congestion**. During times of high demand, gas fees may be higher.
   - Review your transaction history on Etherscan to compare gas fees across multiple transactions.

---

## Step 7: Summary of Gas Fee Study

1. **Observe how the gas fee changes** depending on the time of day, the network load, and transaction type (simple Ether transfer vs. interacting with a smart contract).
2. **Understand how gas prices impact the overall transaction cost** and how MetaMask calculates it.

---

## Conclusion:

By performing these steps, you'll have installed MetaMask, set up a wallet, and learned how to track Ether spending per transaction using gas fees. You'll also understand how gas prices fluctuate and the associated costs for performing transactions on the Ethereum network.
