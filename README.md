## DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)

This section contains the practical assignments and mini-projects related to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms**. Any 4 assignments and 1 mini project are mandatory.

### Assignments:
1. **Fibonacci Numbers & Step Count**  
   Write a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers and find its step count.
   
2. **Job Sequencing with Deadlines**  
   Implement job sequencing with deadlines using a greedy method.

3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**  
   Write a program to solve a fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy method.

4. **0-1 Knapsack Problem**  
   Write a program to solve a 0-1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming or branch and bound strategy.

5. **Binomial Coefficients using Dynamic Programming**  
   Write a program to generate binomial coefficients using dynamic programming.

6. **8-Queens Problem Using Backtracking**  
   Design an 8-Queens matrix with the first Queen placed. Use backtracking to place the remaining Queens to generate the final 8-Queens matrix.
